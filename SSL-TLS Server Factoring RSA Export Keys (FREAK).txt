SSL-TLS Server Factoring RSA Export Keys (FREAK)

The SSL/TLS Server is vulnerable to FREAK attack which allows an attacker to bypass security restrictions when: RSA+EXPORT ciphers are supported, the size of the RSA public key is not stronger than 1024 and the temporary RSA key size is less than 1024 and is stable.

RSA_EXPORT cipher suites should be disabled. Please consider upgrading to TLSv1.2 or higher.
