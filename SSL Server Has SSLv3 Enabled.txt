SSL Server Has SSLv3 Enabled Vulnerability

SSLv3.0 is an insecure protocol. Encryption within SSLv3.0 uses either RC4 stream cipher or a block cipher in CBC mode which are known to have security flaws such as biases and the POODLE attack. An attacker may exploit these vulnerabilities to read and/or modify data in transmission.

SSLv3.0 should be disabled. TLSv1.2 or higher should be used.
