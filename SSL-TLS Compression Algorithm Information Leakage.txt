SSL-TLS Compression Algorithm Information Leakage

SSL/TLS protocols support an optional compression algorithm to ease data transfer. An information leakage was discovered related to this compression algorithm which may lead to compromise of cookies, HTTP session hijacking and impersonation.

SSL/TLS compression algorithms should be disabled. The process of doing so varies on the server environment. Typically, this can be configured within the web server config file.
