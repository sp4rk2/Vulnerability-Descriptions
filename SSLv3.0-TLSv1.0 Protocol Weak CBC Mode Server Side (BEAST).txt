SSLv3.0/TLSv1.0 Protocol Weak CBC Mode Server Side Vulnerability (BEAST)

SSLv3.0 and TLSv1.0 includes a vulnerability where the attributes that are used to mask the plaintext prior to encryption can be predicted by a man in the middle attack. These attributes such as the initialization vector are used to prevent the encryption from being deterministic.

CBC mode ciphers should be disabled. Please consider using TLSv1.2 or higher.
