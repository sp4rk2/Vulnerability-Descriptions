SSL Server Supports Weak Encryption

SSL encryption ciphers are classified on encryption key length as follows:

HIGH - Key length larger than 128 bits.
MEDIUM - Key length equal to 128 bits.
LOW - Key length smaller than 128 bits.

Messages encrypted with LOW encryption ciphers are easy to decrypt. SSL servers should only support MEDIUM or HIGH strength ciphers to guarantee transaction security. An attacker may be able to exploit LOW encryption ciphers and decrypt data.

All LOW encryption ciphers should be disabled. TLSv1.2 or higher should be used.
