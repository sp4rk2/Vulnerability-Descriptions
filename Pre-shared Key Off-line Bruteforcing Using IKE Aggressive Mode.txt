Pre-shared Key Off-line Bruteforcing Using IKE Aggressive Mode

The pre-shared key and other pieces of information are transmitted in an unencrypted hash and can be intercepted. If this network traffic can be captured, the hash can be cracked off-line using a technique similar to password cracking. This authentication hash contains the pre-shared key used to authenticate.

IKE Aggressive mode with pre-shared keys should be avoided where possible. Otherwise a strong pre-shared key should be chosen.
