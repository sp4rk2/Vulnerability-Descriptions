SSL Certificate - Self-Signed Certificate

The client can trust that the server certificate belongs to the server only if it is signed by a mutually trusted third-party Certificate Authority (CA). This can be exploited by performing a Man-In-The-Middle attack.

Please install a certificate signed by a trusted third-party Certificate Authority.
