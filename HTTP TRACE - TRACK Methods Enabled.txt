HTTP TRACE / TRACK Methods Enabled

The web server supports the HTTP TRACE and/or TRACK methods. These methods make it easier for remote attackers to steal cookies, authentication credentials or bypass security mechanisms.

These HTTP methods should be disabled. The way to do this depends on the web server environment. Typically these are disabled within the web server's configuration file.
