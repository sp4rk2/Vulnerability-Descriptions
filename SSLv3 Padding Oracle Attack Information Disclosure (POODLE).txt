SSLv3 Padding Oracle Attack Information Disclosure Vulnerability (POODLE)

This vulnerability lies within version 3 of the SSL encryption protocol. POODLE or Padding Orcale On Downgraded Legacy Encryption allows an attacker to view encrypted information in plaintext that has been encrypted using SSLv3.

To prevent this vulnerability, servers should disable SSLv3 support completely. This includes having SSLv3 as a fallback option as there are methods an attacker can use to force the use of SSLv3 communication. Please consider using TLSv1.2 or higher.
