Web Server HTTP Trace - Track Method Support Cross-Site Tracing Vulnerability

The web server supports the HTTP TRACE/TRACK method. This method is used for debugging during development. A vulnerability was found that allows an attacker to compromise authentication credentials using a method similar to cross site scripting. This can be exploited even when the web application is not vulnerable to cross site scripting attacks due to input validation errors.

The HTTP method TRACE/TRACK should be disabled.
