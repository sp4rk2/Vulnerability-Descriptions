Web Server Internal IP Address/Internal Network Name Disclosure

This vulnerability allows an attacker to gain the internal IP address or internal network name of the device. When crafting a specially formed GET request and causing the web server to respond with a 3XX Object Moved error message, the internal IP/network name is disclosed.
