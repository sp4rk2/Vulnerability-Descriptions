Weak IPsec Encryption Settings

The key exchange server used to negotiate encryption keys for IPsec VPNs has been configured insecurely. The server allows clients to establish VPN connections with insecure encryption settings or key lengths. An attacker with access to the VPN data stream may be able to recover the used session key by performing attacks such as brute-forcing. This can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information such as passwords and files.

Disable the encryption algorithm "DES" that uses a key length of 56 bits, and the key exchange algorithm DH768. Instead, 3DES and DH2048 can be used.
