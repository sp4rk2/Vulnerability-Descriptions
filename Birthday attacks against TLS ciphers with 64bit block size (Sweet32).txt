Birthday attacks against TLS ciphers with 64bit block size vulnerability (Sweet32)

The Sweet32 attack allows an attacker to identify and recover small pieces of plaintext from encrypted data in transmission when encrypted using 64-bit block ciphers such as 3DES and Blowfish.
By default, servers have the 3DES cipher enabled when using TLS.

To prevent this attack from happening, we suggest that all 64-bit block ciphers are disabled and stronger ciphers such as AES are used instead.
