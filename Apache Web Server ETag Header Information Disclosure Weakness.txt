Apache Web Server ETag Header Information Disclosure Weakness

The Apache HTTP Server includes a cache management feature which makes use of an entity tag header (ETag). When this HTTP header is enabled and a HTTP request is made for a document relating to a specific file, an ETag header is included in the response. This ETag header includes various file attributes and information such as the files inode number. An inode number may include the following information which should not be dislosed:

File types
Permissions
User ID
Group ID
FileSize
Time Stamps
File Deletion Time
Links
Location of file

Please make sure you are running the most recent version of Apache. In the most recent versions, it is possible to configure the FileETag directive to generate ETag headers without inode information. Within Apache, add the following entry within the apache config file:

Header unset
ETagFileETag none
