L2TP VPN Tunnelling Allowed Without Encryption

Using evidence from the above vulnerabilities (4.2, 4.3), the L2TP service is likely to accept connections without encryption meaning that not only is the authentication process unencrypted, but the communication between the client and server after establishing a connection is also unencrypted.

All incoming UDP traffic to this port should only be permitted if the packets contain encapsulating security payload encryption headers. All unencrypted UDP traffic to this port should be blocked.
