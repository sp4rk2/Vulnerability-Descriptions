ICMP Timestamp Request

ICMP, the protocol used to provide a protocol layer the ability to inform gateways of the inner-connectivity and accessibility of other gateways or hosts, can produce information that should not be disclosed. When performing a ICMP Timestamp request, the server responds with packets that contains information about the systems internal clock. Attackers can use this vulnerability to defeat time based authentication schemes.

ICMP message of the type "Timestamp" and "Timestamp Reply" can be filtered out at the firewall level, however you should never filter all ICMP messages as some of them are necessary for correct behaviour of the Operating System. If a firewall is not in place, then the operating system should be configured to prevent responding with timestamp information.
