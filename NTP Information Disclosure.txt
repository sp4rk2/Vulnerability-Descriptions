NTP Information Disclosure

An NTP server running on the public interface allows a user to query the NTP server for information. For example, connecting to the NTP server and executing specific commands may present the user with important information regarding the server. This information should not be disclosed. 

In order to remediate this vulnerability, the NTP server should be re-configured so it is not publicly accessible. If this is not possible, then the NTP server should be re-configured to prevent it from disclosing any internal information.
