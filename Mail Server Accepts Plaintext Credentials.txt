Mail Server Accepts Plaintext Credentials

The mail server accepts PLAIN or LOGIN as one of the AUTH parameters. This means that the credentials are transmitted in plaintext over the network and no encryption is performed. Malicious users are able to obtain mail server credentials by traffic sniffing.

Plaintext authentication should be disabled. Consider using more advanced authentication methods such as CRAM-MD5 or DIGEST-MD5.
