SSL Certificate - Subject Common Name Does Not Match Server FQDN

A certificate whose Subject commonName or subjectAltName does not match the fully qualified domain name offers only encryption without authentication. An attacker can perform a Man-In-The-Middle attack to lure the client to a different server, where they could then steal the encryption communication.

A certificate whose Subject commonName or subjectAltName matches the server FQDN should be installed.
