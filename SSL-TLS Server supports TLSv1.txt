SSL-TLS Server supports TLSv1.0

TLSv1.0 has various known security flaws. TLSv1.0 uses either the RC4 stream cipher, or a block cipher in CBC mode. RC4 is known to have biases and the block cipher is vulnerable to the POODLE attack. TLSv1.0 can also be downgraded to a weaker connection such as SSL v3.0, thus weakening security. An attacker may exploit these vulnerabilities to conduct Man-In-The_Middle attacks or to decrypt data in transmission.

TLSv1.0 should be disabled. Please consider using TLSv1.2 or higher.
