SSL Server Allows Anonymous Authentication

A vulnerability exists within SSL communication where clients are allowed to connect using no authentication algorithm. SSL client-server communication may use several different types of authentication, however they are also able to use none. When none is used, the communications are vulnerable to a Man-In-The-Middle attack.

All support for anonymous authentication should be disabled within the web server. This can be done within the web server configuration file.
