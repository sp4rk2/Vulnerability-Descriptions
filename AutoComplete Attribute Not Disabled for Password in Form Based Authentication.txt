AutoComplete Attribute Not Disabled for Password in Form Based Authentication

The web server allows form based authentication without disabling the AutoComplete feature for the password field. Autocomplete should be turned off for any input that takes sensitive information.

Within the HTML form, adding the attribute "autocomplete='off'" to the form or input element will prevent the browser from prompting the user to save the form values for later use.
