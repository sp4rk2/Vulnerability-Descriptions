SSL Certificate - Invalid Maximum Validity Date

Certification Authorities are not permitted to issue SSL certificates with a validity period greater than 39 months. SSL certificates have limited validity dates so that the CA identity informaiton is re-authenticated more frequently.

Please install a server certificate with a recommended maximum validity date.
