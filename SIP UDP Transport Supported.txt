SIP UDP Transport Supported

SIP is the voice over IP session initialization protocol. An attacker may spoof the UDP packets to cause a denial of service or take over the call transaction.

SIP supports UDP, TCP and TLS as the transport layer. TCP or TLS should be used, and if possible, UDP should be disabled.
