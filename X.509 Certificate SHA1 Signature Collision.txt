X.509 Certificate SHA1 Signature Collision

The hash algorithms that are used to sign the X.509 certificates used to verify identity in SSL communication are depreciated. The detected algorithm is SHA1. An attacker who can exploit this vulnerability can conduct phishing attacks and impersonate websites by taking advantage of malicious certificates.

If the certificate is signed using SHA1, then a new certificate should be obtained which uses a more collision proof hashing algorithm such as SHA-256.
