SSL-TLS use of weak RC4 cipher

The SSL/TLS server is using the RC4 cipher which has known vulnerabilities. RC4 is known to have biases in the output which makes statistical analysis of ciphertext more practical. This can lead to data being recovered.

RC4 should not be used where possible. Please consider using TLSv1.2 or higher.
